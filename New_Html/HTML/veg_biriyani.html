    <h2>Steps for  Making Veg Biriyani</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and salt. Cook the rice until it is about 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside. </li>
        <li>Prepare the Vegetables: In a pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute. Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft.</li>
        <li>Add Vegetables: Add the mixed vegetables to the pan. Stir well. Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, biryani masala powder (if using), and salt. Cook until the vegetables are partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Add Yogurt: Add plain yogurt to the vegetable mixture and mix well. Cook for a few more minutes until the vegetables are tender but not mushy.</li>
        <li>Layering the Biryani: In a large heavy-bottomed pot or biryani pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice, followed by the vegetable mixture. Sprinkle slit green chilies, fresh coriander leaves, and fried onions (if using). Repeat the layering with the remaining rice and vegetables.</li>
        <li>Cooking the Biryani: Drizzle saffron-infused milk over the top layer for color and flavor. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat for about 20-30 minutes or until the rice and vegetables are fully cooked and flavors are well blended.</li>
        <li>Final Touch: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers before serving. Garnish with additional coriander leaves and fried onions if desired.</li>
