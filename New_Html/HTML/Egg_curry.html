    <h2>Steps for  Making Egg Curry</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Hard-Boiled Eggs: Boil the eggs until they are hard-boiled, then peel and cut them in half. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Sauté Onions: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Sauté for a minute until the spices release their aroma.</li>

        <li>Add Onions: Add chopped onions and cook until they become golden brown.</li>

        <li>Add Ginger-Garlic Paste: Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>

        <li>Add Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>

        <li>Add Spices: Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, ground coriander, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>

        <li>Add Water: If the mixture becomes too dry, you can add a little water to form a thick gravy.</li>

        <li>Add Eggs: Gently place the halved boiled eggs into the curry, making sure they are coated with the sauce.</li>

        <li>Simmer: Allow the curry to simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the eggs to absorb the spices.</li>

        <li>Garnish: Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.</li>

    </ol>
