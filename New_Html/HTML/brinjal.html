    <h2>Steps for  Making Brinjal Curry</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Brinjals: Wash the brinjals, remove the stem, and chop them into cubes. You can soak them in water to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Sauté Mustard and Cumin Seeds: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds. Allow them to splutter.
        </li>
        <li>Add Onions: Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li>
        <li>Add Ginger-Garlic Paste: Add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.  </li>
        <li>Add Spices: Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.        </li>
        <li>Add Brinjals: Add the chopped brinjals and coat them well with the spice mixture.        </li>
        <li>Cook Covered: Cover the pan and let the brinjals cook on low to medium heat until they are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>Check for Doneness: The brinjals are done when they are soft and cooked through. You can test by inserting a knife or fork into a piece; it should go in easily.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish: Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.        </li>
    </ol>
