    <h2>Steps for  Making Lemon Rice</h2>

    <ol>
        <li> Cook the Rice: Cook the basmati rice according to package instructions. Once cooked, spread the rice on a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Tempering (Tadka): Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add urad dal and chana dal. Sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add Green Chilies and Curry Leaves: Add finely chopped green chilies and curry leaves. Sauté for a minute</li>
        <li>Add Peanuts and Cashews: Add roasted peanuts and cashews (if using). Stir and cook until they are lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>Add Turmeric Powder: Add turmeric powder and mix well. The turmeric gives the rice its characteristic yellow color</li>
        <li>Mix in Rice: Add the cooled, cooked rice to the pan. Gently mix to combine with the tempering</li>
        <li>Add Lemon Juice: Squeeze the juice of one lemon into the rice. Adjust the quantity of lemon juice according to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Add Grated Coconut: Add grated coconut to the rice and mix well. The coconut adds a nice texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Season with Salt: Season the lemon rice with salt according to your taste. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Garnish with fresh coriander leaves. Serve the lemon rice hot as is or with a side of yogurt or a pickle.</li>
