    </h2>
    <p>Any type of biryani consists of four main components: rice, meat, marinade, and spices.</p>
    <p>The spices and condiments used in biryani may include fennel seeds, ghee (clarified butter), nutmeg, mace, pepper, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, coriander, mint, ginger, onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and garlic. </p>

    <h2>Steps for  Making Biriyani</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice, bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, and salt. Cook the rice until it is about 70-80% cooked. Drain the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, biryani masala powder (if using), and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook until it is partially cooked and the yogurt has blended well with the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot or biryani pot, layer half of the partially cooked rice, followed by the chicken mixture. Sprinkle chopped mint leaves, cilantro, and half of the fried onions.</li>
        
        <li>Layer the remaining rice on top. Drizzle saffron-infused milk over the rice for color and flavor. Top with the remaining fried onions, mint leaves, and cilantro</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat for about 20-30 minutes or until the rice and chicken are fully cooked and flavors are well blended.</li>
        <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers before serving</li>
    
    </ol>
